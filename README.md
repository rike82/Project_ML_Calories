<h1>Project ML Calories</h1> 
<p>This is a project about machine leraning<br> My goal was to train the best possible model on a fitness-tracker dataset to predict the calorie-intake of a person depending on diffrent factors<br>
like height, weight, duration and intensity(heartbeat) of the training.<br>
Since the data I got from kaggle was synthetic and obviously not that great, my model turned out to be... lets call it useless..<br></p>
