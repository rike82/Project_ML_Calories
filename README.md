<h1>&#x1F3CB; Project ML Calories &#127939;</h1> 
<p>This is a project about supervised machine learning.<br> My goal was to train the best possible model on a fitness-tracker dataset to predict the calorie-intake of a person depending on diffrent factors<br>
like height, weight, duration and intensity(heartbeat) of the training.<br>
&#10146; Kaggle Dataset:  <a href = 'https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arnavsmayan/fitness-tracker-dataset'>Fitness Tracker Dataset</a><br>
Since the data I got from kaggle was synthetic and obviously not that great, my model turned out to be...uhm.. lets call it useless..<br>
